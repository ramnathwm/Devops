This file contain ant commands and notes.
BUILD: build is converting source file into Executable component like jar,war, Ear.
# Buildconfiguration file is Build.xml
# To create Build go to ant installed directry and execut command ant
#TO  execute build.xml if name changed
	$ ant –f filename
	$ ant –f config.xml
	$ ant –file cinfig.xml
	$ ant –buildfile config.xml
# 3 main buildn blocks are there in ant script
	1) project	
	2) target 
	3) tasks
#root elememt of ant script is project its have 3 attributess. Name, default, basedir.

<project name=”project1” default=”target2” basedir=”c/Desktop/Ant”

# name: name of project, default target is used when no targets specified. And basedir base directory of project.
# target is collection of task that what you want to be run as 1 unit. target have dependency on another target . deploy target may have depends on pakcge and package may dependency on compile target.

<target name=”target1” depends =”target2”>

<target name=”target2”>

# task will perform works in ant. 
# javac i s tag in task to compile source code. This have 2 attributs . 1 is source dir and second is destination dir.
<javac srcdir =”/temp//src/” destdir=”/tmp/classes”
# echo is used to print text 
# properties are key value pairs .
< property name=”a” value=20/>
# We can change propert at th time of running script by ant –D propertyname=value
# we can also define property file in  ant.
We will define propert=value in file like below.
Ram.properties(file name)
name="RAMNATH REDDY"
age="28" 
# using jar tag we crate jar file.
<jar destfile=”app.jar” basedir=”/classes”>
# FILElist is  explicit list of files
# fileset is group of files.we use pattern to define fileset . pattern matched files comes and one group.
# we will debug ant script ant –D
# we will all targets of build file by  ant –p command.
# to execute a system commands we use exec 
<exec executable=”bin/bash”>
< arg value  = scriptname>
<arg value =scriptlocation>
</exec>
# ant all is used to call another target in present target.
<target name=”default”>
<antcall target=”target2”>
</antcall>
</target>
# ant task is used to include another build.xml in present one.
<ant antfile =”subproject/subbuild.xml”/>
# class path contain all jar files needed by project 
<path id=”calsspath.base”>
<path element location =” “/>
# referring class path 
<classpath refid=”claspath.base/>
# we will call target from command line by $ ant target-name
# To build we need source code build.xml and processes 
# if  build fails its show the build failed message and we can see error log . if we will find reason to build file we will email error log to developer.
# Common build issues are class path not set properly, environment related issues, dependency jar fiels are not copid properly.

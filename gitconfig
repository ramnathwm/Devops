	$  Git gathers any commits from the target branch that do not exist in your current branch and stores them in your local repository. However, it does not merge them with your current branch
 
 # what  we have to do to ignore  files from working copy?
	$ Put the excludes in your $GIT_DIR/info/exclude file, if this is specific to one tree.
  	$ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore and add patterns to your ~/.gitignore. 

#  Display difference or display difference of working copy and staging area differences
	$ git diff
# Rename the file name (“filetorename”  to “name-renamed”)

#  Add and commit at a time ( add to tagging area and commit in ine command )
	$ git commit –a –m “commit message”
# Amend the commit or undo the commit

## It lets you combine staged changes with the previous commit instead of committing it as an entirely new snapshot. amending doesn’t just alter the most recent commit—it replaces it entirely.
# to chage the commit message of previus commit 
	$ git commit --amend -m "commit message added after amend"

# Unstaging the staged file.(2 files staged  and i want to unstaged 1 file)

## -o used to specify output filename
# Create a Archive.
	$ git archive branch-name –o file-name
	$ git archive master  --format=tar -o releaseV1.0
# to test that file is tar or not simply copy into one location and extract $tar –xvf rleaseV1.0

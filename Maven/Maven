Mavn have folder structure. Maven specifya 3 things to identify artifacts uniquely . those are group-id, artifact-id and version.
Maven Configuration file is Pom.xml
There are 3 built-in lifecycles are there
1)default
2)clean
3)site
Defult life cycle have 6 phases. those are Validate, Complie,Test, Packege, Install, Deploy.
validate verify syntactical of pom.xmland validate all necessary information is avilable or not.
comple phase convert the source code it classes. 
test phase will execute unit test cases and test the code.
package phase will make the jar , war, ear  Executable component.
Install phase install packege into local repository.MVN install copy artifact into local repository.
Deploy phase COPY THE PACKAGE INTO WEBSERVER or release environment and copy final packege into remote repository for sharing with other Developers.MVN deploy copy the artifact in to remote repository.
Build profiel is set of configuation value .types of profiles are project,peruser,global.
Mavven repository is place where all project jars, libraries are plgins or any othe project artifacts are can be stored and used by maven easily.
Repositories are local, central, remote.
local is local to individual machine.Its get created at first time we run any maven command. location is $Home/.M2.
Central repository is provided by maven community . its contain large number of commanly used labraries.
When maven doesnt found in local repository its look inro central repository.
Some time maven can't find in cental repository also that time its look into remote repository. It is developers own custom repository contain required jar are other project jars.
In maven we dont have classpath inside of this we use dependency.
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupid>-----</groupid>
		<artifactid>---</artifactid>
		<version>---</version>
	</dependency>

</dependencies>

nexus and artifatory are version controls for jar,war,ear.
Scope define depedency . scope define when we want to load jarfiles . defaltt scope is compile. scopes are complie, runtime,provided,test,system,import.
Actual task is done by plugin in maven.
For default tasks plugins are wrote by default in pom.xml .To call our own tasks we have to write plugins our own. 
<plugins>
	<plugin>
		<groupid>--------</groupid>
		<artifactid>-----</artifactid>
		<version>--------</versionid>
	</plugin>
</plugins>
